        ANSWERING TO USER QUESTIONS BY PASSING A DATA AS A PDF FILE

Description:
------------
This project is about building a conversational AI system capable of answering questions and engaging in dialogue. It uses advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques to generate text responses, retrieve relevant information from documents, and maintain context in conversations. The system includes features such as text generation, question answering, integration of external data sources, and a user-friendly graphical interface for interaction.

Installation:
-------------
	* copy the main.ipynb file in the Google Colab
        * You no need to install any requirements
	* The requirements code itself written in the main file


Usage:
	 	
	1. Download the file 
		(or)
	click this link: (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VKTnNtpyBh1GV6cXYFHmh2dSbUwLc7cd?usp=sharing&authuser=1#scrollTo=0EaBXbiyJTPu)

	2.Change the Runtime source to GPU or T4PU
	
	3.First run the packages in the code
	
	4.Run the code one by one 

Examples:
---------

	1.If runtime error occured in the third block of code you needs to change resource t gpu which is found in last right of the code
